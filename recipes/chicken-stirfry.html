        <li>Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes, then add the chicken and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat up the pan on the highest setting until you see small streaks of smoke.</li>
        <li>When you see the small streaks of smoke, add some oil to the pan and swirl it around to oil up the pan's inner surface and wait for light smoke.</li>
        <li>Once you see the oil smoking, discard it to somewhere like, a ceramic bowl for later use to adjust moistness for later.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper, then cook and stir until it's tender.</li>
        <li>Set the current contents of the pan outside to cook the chicken in about 2 minutes for each side or until it's browned.</li>
        <li>Add the previous contents back with the chicken's marinade and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cook for like 5-7 minutes more, or until you can't get any salmonella when eating the chicken.</li>
        <li>Serve.</li>
