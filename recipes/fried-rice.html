    <hr>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chopped up Garlic</li>
        <li>Day-old rice - It's best if you use leftover rice than a freshly cooked one</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>High smoking point oil (e.g. Canola, Grapeseed, Peanut, etc.)</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Heat up the pan on the highest setting until you see small streaks of smoke.</li>
        <li>When you see the small streaks of smoke, add some oil to the pan and swirl it around to oil up the pan's inner surface and wait for light smoke.</li>
        <li>Once you see the oil smoking, discard it to somewhere like, a ceramic bowl for later use to make the fried rice not dry.</li>
        <li>Add a fresh batch of oil and once you see it shimmer, turn the heat down to medium and add the garlic.</li>
        <li>Saute the garlic until you can smell the aroma, then add the rice and put the heat back to the highest setting.</li>
        <li>Stirr it up around, occasionally bashing clumps to unclump it, then add salt.</li>
        <li>Serve.</li>
    </ol>
